OpenSSH, short for Open Secure Shell, is a free suite of security-related network-level utilities based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It allows for encrypted communication over a network, making it a popular choice for remote server administration, file transfers, and other secure network services.

Here are some key points about OpenSSH:

1. **Encryption**: OpenSSH provides secure encrypted communications over potentially insecure networks. This ensures that passwords, user data, and all transmitted information remain confidential and cannot be easily intercepted or understood even if intercepted.

2. **Authentication**: Besides traditional password authentication, OpenSSH supports public key authentication, providing an even stronger level of security.

3. **Tools and Utilities**: The OpenSSH suite provides several tools:
   - `ssh`: The primary tool for encrypted remote shell sessions.
   - `scp`: A secure way to copy files between hosts.
   - `sftp`: A secure file transfer protocol utility.
   - `ssh-keygen`: A tool to create, manage, and convert authentication keys.
   - `ssh-agent`: Helps in handling private keys for public key authentication.
   - `ssh-add`: Adds private key identities to the authentication agent (`ssh-agent`).
   - `sshd`: The SSH server daemon.

4. **Tunneling and Port Forwarding**: One of the powerful features of SSH is its ability to tunnel other protocols, allowing for encrypted use of otherwise unencrypted protocols. This can be used for securing traffic, bypassing firewalls, or creating VPN-like setups.

5. **Origin and Development**: OpenSSH originated as a fork from the last free version of Tatu Yl√∂nen's SSH, aiming to be a 100% free version without proprietary components. It's actively developed and maintained by the OpenBSD project but is available for almost all operating systems, including Linux, Unix, and Windows.

6. **Configuration**: OpenSSH's client and server behavior can be customized through configuration files. The client's primary configuration file is typically `~/.ssh/config` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, while the server's configuration is usually found in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.


Difference between SSH Vs Telnet
---

SSH (Secure Shell) and Telnet are both network protocols that allow users to remotely access and manage other machines over a network. However, there are significant differences between the two, especially in terms of security. Here's a comparison:

1. **Encryption**:
   - **SSH**: SSH encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server. This ensures that sensitive information like passwords and user commands remain confidential, even if someone intercepts the traffic.
   - **Telnet**: Telnet transmits data in plaintext. Anyone with access to the network can easily eavesdrop on a Telnet session, capturing passwords, commands, and any other data.

2. **Authentication**:
   - **SSH**: Apart from traditional password authentication, SSH supports public key authentication, providing an added layer of security. An intruder would need both the private key and the passphrase to gain unauthorized access.
   - **Telnet**: Only password-based authentication is available, and since it's sent in plaintext, it's vulnerable to interception.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - **SSH**: Offers data integrity checks. This ensures that the data sent and received is not tampered with during transit.
   - **Telnet**: No inherent data integrity features are present.

4. **Port Number**:
   - **SSH**: Typically operates on port 22.
   - **Telnet**: Typically operates on port 23.

5. **Usage**:
   - **SSH**: Due to its secure nature, SSH has largely replaced other insecure remote login protocols (including Telnet) on most systems, especially Unix and Linux systems.
   - **Telnet**: Due to its security vulnerabilities, Telnet usage has diminished over the years. It's now mainly used in controlled environments or for accessing older equipment that doesn't support SSH.

6. **Tunneling**:
   - **SSH**: Has the ability to tunnel other protocols, allowing users to encrypt the traffic of other applications or even forward ports in a secure manner.
   - **Telnet**: Lacks tunneling capabilities.

7. **Popularity and Support**:
   - **SSH**: Very popular and supported by most modern systems. Tools like OpenSSH provide free and open-source SSH client and server software.
   - **Telnet**: Its usage has declined over time, mainly due to its security concerns. However, it's still available on many systems, especially for backward compatibility or specific use cases.

In conclusion, while both SSH and Telnet can provide remote access to systems, SSH is the recommended choice for almost all scenarios because of its enhanced security features. Telnet should only be used in environments where security isn't a concern or where SSH is not an option.

For configuring OpenSSH on a system, you typically need two main packages:

1. **openssh-server**: This package provides the `sshd` daemon which allows SSH clients to connect to the server. 

2. **openssh-clients**: This package provides SSH client utilities like `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, and others that are useful for connecting to SSH servers.

On many Linux distributions, these packages might be included by default. However, if they're not, you can manually install them.

For example, on a CentOS or RHEL system, you would use the `yum` or `dnf` package manager:

```bash
sudo dnf install openssh-server openssh-clients
```

On a Debian or Ubuntu system, you would use the `apt` package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client
```

After installing, you can start and enable the SSH server with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

Remember to adjust the firewall settings if necessary to allow SSH traffic (typically on port 22) to pass through.

Also, note that the OpenSSH suite provides more than just these basic packages. There are other utilities and tools available for specialized needs, but for the majority of users, the server and client packages will suffice.
