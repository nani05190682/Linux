**SSH Passwordless Login on RHEL**

**Introduction:**
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for securely operating network services over an unsecured network. Passwordless authentication via SSH ensures secure communication without the hassle of constantly remembering or inputting passwords.

**Benefits:**

- **Security:** Cryptographic keys are generally more complex than passwords, making them harder to crack.
- **Convenience:** Once set up, you don't have to remember or input passwords for each login.
- **Automation:** Useful in scripts and automated tasks that require SSH connections.

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Two Systems:** One will act as the local machine (client), and the other is the remote machine (server) you want to access without a password.
2. **SSH Installed:** Ensure that OpenSSH server and client tools are installed on the respective systems.

**Step 1: Generating the SSH Key Pair**

- On your local machine, initiate the key generation process:
  ```bash
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```
- This command generates an RSA key pair. You'll be prompted for a location to save the keys. The default location is `~/.ssh/` with filenames `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).
  
- **Passphrase:** It's advised to set a passphrase for additional security. This is an encryption key for your private key. Even if someone gets hold of your private key, they would still need this passphrase to use it.

**Step 2: Transferring the Public Key**

The public key (`id_rsa.pub`) must be placed on the remote machine to allow passwordless logins.

- Use the `ssh-copy-id` utility for easy transfer:
  ```bash
  $ ssh-copy-id username@remote_server_ip
  ```

**Step 3: Manual Transfer (If Needed)**

- On your local machine, display the public key:
  ```bash
  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
- Copy the output.
- SSH into your remote machine, then paste and append the copied key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. If the file doesn't exist, this command will create it:
  ```bash
  $ echo "PASTE_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

**Step 4: Ensuring Correct Permissions**

For security reasons, it's vital to set strict permissions for the involved directories and files:

- On local machine:
  ```bash
  $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- On remote machine:
  ```bash
  $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

**Step 5: Testing the Setup**

SSH from your local machine to the remote server:

```bash
$ ssh username@remote_server_ip
```
If everything is configured correctly, you'll access the remote machine without being prompted for a password.

**Security Tips:**

1. **Backup your keys:** Especially the private key. If lost, you might lose access.
2. **Regular Key Rotation:** Periodically generate a new key pair and replace the old ones on machines you access.
3. **Restrict key usage:** If a particular key should only be used for specific tasks (like automated backups), ensure it has limited rights on the server.

**Conclusion:**
Setting up SSH passwordless login on RHEL8 enhances both security and efficiency. Whether for routine tasks or automation scripts, this approach streamlines workflows while keeping communication secure.
