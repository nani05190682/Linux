**To configure Apache in CentOS 8, you can follow these steps:**
===
1. Install Apache by running the following command: `sudo dnf install httpd`
2. Start the Apache service by running: `sudo systemctl start httpd`
3. Configure Apache to start at boot time: `sudo systemctl enable httpd`
4. Open port 80 in the firewall to allow HTTP traffic: `sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`
5. Create a virtual host configuration file in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory with your desired configuration.
6. Test the Apache configuration by visiting your server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.

**What is Namebased Virtualhosting in Apache centos8?**
---
Name-based virtual hosting is a technique used to serve multiple websites on a single IP address using a single Apache server. With name-based virtual hosting, the server uses the domain name specified in the HTTP request header to determine which website to serve.

When a client sends an HTTP request to the server, it includes the domain name in the Host header. The server uses this information to match the domain name to a virtual host configuration and serves the appropriate website.

Name-based virtual hosting is useful when you want to host multiple websites on a single server and you have a limited number of IP addresses available. It is also easier to set up and manage than IP-based virtual hosting, where each website requires its own IP address.

In Apache on CentOS 8, you can configure name-based virtual hosting by creating multiple virtual host configuration files, each with its own ServerName directive and DocumentRoot. When a client sends an HTTP request with a domain name that matches one of the ServerName directives, Apache serves the website specified by that virtual host configuration file.


To configure virtual hosting in CentOS 8 with Apache, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your website files. For example, `sudo mkdir /var/www/example.com`
2. Set the appropriate permissions for the directory: `sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/example.com`
3. Create a new virtual host configuration file in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory with your desired configuration. For example, `sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.com.conf`
4. In the virtual host configuration file, add the following lines:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

5. Save and close the file.
6. Restart the Apache service to apply the changes: `sudo systemctl restart httpd`
7. Add an entry to your local hosts file to point the domain name to your server's IP address. For example, `sudo nano /etc/hosts` and add a line like `192.0.2.1 example.com`
8. Test your virtual host configuration by visiting `http://example.com` in a web browser.

To configure name-based virtual hosting in Apache on CentOS 8, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your website files. For example, `sudo mkdir /var/www/example.com`
2. Set the appropriate permissions for the directory: `sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/example.com`
3. Create a new virtual host configuration file in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory with your desired configuration. For example, `sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.com.conf`
4. In the virtual host configuration file, add the following lines:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

5. Save and close the file.
6. Create another virtual host configuration file for your second website. For example, `sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example2.com.conf`
7. In the second virtual host configuration file, add the following lines:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example2.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example2.com-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example2.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

8. Save and close the file.
9. Restart the Apache service to apply the changes: `sudo systemctl restart httpd`
10. Add entries to your local hosts file to point the domain names to your server's IP address. For example, `sudo nano /etc/hosts` and add lines like:

```
192.0.2.1 example.com
192.0.2.1 example2.com
```

11. Test your virtual host configuration by visiting `http://example.com` and `http://example2.com` in a web browser.

How to configure IP based Virtual Hosting in Apache centos8?
To configure IP-based virtual hosting in Apache on CentOS 8, you can follow these steps:

1. Assign a unique IP address to each website you want to host on the server.
2. Create a new directory for your first website files. For example, `sudo mkdir /var/www/example.com`
3. Set the appropriate permissions for the directory: `sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/example.com`
4. Create a new virtual host configuration file in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory with your desired configuration. For example, `sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.com.conf`
5. In the virtual host configuration file, add the following lines:

```
<VirtualHost 192.0.2.1:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
    ServerName example.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Replace `192.0.2.1` with the IP address assigned to your first website.

6. Save and close the file.
7. Create another directory for your second website files. For example, `sudo mkdir /var/www/example2.com`
8. Set the appropriate permissions for the directory: `sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/example2.com`
9. Create another virtual host configuration file for your second website. For example, `sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/example2.com.conf`
10. In the second virtual host configuration file, add the following lines:

```
<VirtualHost 192.0.2.2:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2.com
    ServerName example2.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example2.com-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example2.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Replace `192.0.2.2` with the IP address assigned to your second website.

11. Save and close the file.
12. Restart the Apache service to apply the changes: `sudo systemctl restart httpd`
13. Test your virtual host configuration by visiting `http://192.0.2.1` and `http://192.0.2.2` in a web browser.

That's it! You should now have two IP-based virtual hosts configured on your CentOS 8 server. You can repeat these steps to configure additional virtual hosts as needed, each with its own unique IP address and DocumentRoot directory.
