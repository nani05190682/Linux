Certainly! Here's a guide on how to configure Postfix as an SMTP server on CentOS followed by a lab exercise.

### Configuring Postfix SMTP on CentOS:

1. **Install Postfix and related tools**:
   
   Install Postfix, which will replace the default Sendmail MTA:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y postfix
   ```

2. **Start and Enable Postfix**:

   Enable Postfix to start on boot and then start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable postfix
   sudo systemctl start postfix
   ```

3. **Configure main Postfix settings**:

   Open the main configuration file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
   ```

   Adjust or add the following basic configurations:

   ```
   myhostname = mail.yourdomain.com
   mydomain = yourdomain.com
   myorigin = $mydomain
   inet_interfaces = all
   mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
   ```

   `yourdomain.com` should be replaced with your actual domain name.

4. **Restart Postfix to apply changes**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postfix
   ```

5. **Firewall Configuration**:

   If you're running a firewall, you'll need to allow traffic on the SMTP port (25):

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=smtp
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

6. **Testing**:

   Send a test email to yourself or an external email:
   ```bash
   echo "Test Email content" | mail -s "Test Email" your_email@yourdomain.com
   ```

### Lab Exercise: Configure Postfix as a Local-only SMTP Relay

**Objective:** Set up Postfix so that applications on the same server can send emails to external recipients, but prevent the server from being an open relay.

**Tasks**:

1. Install Postfix if not already installed.

2. Modify the Postfix configuration to only listen on the localhost interface:

   In `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:
   ```
   inet_interfaces = localhost
   ```

3. Configure a relay host if your environment requires emails to be sent through another SMTP server:

   In `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:
   ```
   relayhost = [smtp.your-isp.com]
   ```

   Replace `smtp.your-isp.com` with your SMTP relay server's address.

4. Restart Postfix to apply the changes.

5. Send a test email to an external recipient and verify it's received.

6. Attempt to connect to the SMTP port (25) from another machine. This should fail, indicating that Postfix is only listening on the localhost.

**Validation**:

- A test email sent from the server should be received by external recipients.
- Attempts to use the server as an open relay from external machines should fail.

Remember to always keep your Postfix installation and CentOS system updated, and periodically review Postfix documentation to ensure optimal and secure configuration.
